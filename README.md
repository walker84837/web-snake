# web-snake

A simple snake game implemented in TypeScript, compiled to JavaScript. This project contains a basic implementation of the classic snake game using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript, and CSS for styling. The game allows the player to control a snake, eat food, and grow longer. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Control the snake's movement using arrow keys.
- Eat food to increase the snake's length and score.
- Avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Randomly generated food position for each game session.

## Known Issues

- The snake may occasionally overlap with itself in certain cases.
- There isn't any pause-resume features.
- The canvas isn't aligned with the snake's dimensions.
- On small screens, the canvas may be too tall to be visible all at once.
- There are no comfort features.
- There is no score & high score counter.

## What's different?

- This snake game implementation introduces responsive design, allowing the game to adapt to different screen sizes.
- The game supports arrow key controls for basic controls.
- The project is **originally** written in TypeScript (I'm planning on rewriting the TypeScript code, and recompiling the JS script) for improved code organization and type safety.
